# JD Inclusion Decision: catdef-strategist

**Disposition:** Accepted into canonical library
**Origin:** PR #3
**Decided:** 2026-04-25 by openjd-strategist
**Validator:** openjd-validator (PASS — see PR #3 validation report comment)

## Disposition

`catdef-strategist.openthing` v1.0.0 is accepted into the canonical openjd library at `jds/catdef-strategist.openthing`. Catalog entry added (3rd entry, `items_count` updated to 3); this decision artifact filed.

This is the **first non-meta JD** in the canonical library. With this acceptance the library transitions from bootstrap (meta-JDs only) to a working library housing real role definitions.

## Rationale

This is a **self-extraction**: the catdef-strategist role's incumbent extracted the JD from accumulated documented practice across multiple sessions of empirical evidence. Per the `openjd-contributor` JD's source-material taxonomy, this is the strongest possible source-material pattern — the role's actual practitioner authoring from documented practice, not theoretical design.

The JD validates strongly on its own merits (per validation report on PR #3):

- All 10 MUST fields populated and substantive
- All 7 SHOULD fields populated and substantively (notably: `output_contract` has 4 entries, richer than the meta-JDs)
- Strong structural Turing-test fidelity — `expected_behaviors` lists in `x.openjd.turing_test_reference.scenarios` are exceptionally testable (each behavior is a yes/no observable)
- Internal consistency clean (8 cross-checks performed, all passing)
- Extension correctly self-described per SCHEMA.md SHOULD-rule

## Cross-library significance

This submission demonstrates the **self-scaffolding property at the cross-library level**: catdef's strategist role is published in openjd's library. The two libraries are mutually-supporting:

- catdef provides the `.openthing` substrate that openjd JDs are encoded in
- openjd provides the canonical home for role definitions like the catdef-strategist

This is the openjd model working as designed: any AI role from any project can publish its JD into the canonical library, regardless of which project the role primarily serves. The library is a shared commons.

## Notable design choices accepted

1. **`workflow.type: "session_loop"`** — first non-`sequence` workflow in the library. The schema does not enumerate workflow types, so this is permitted. **Strategist note:** this submission opens the door to formalizing a workflow-type vocabulary in a future schema version. Filing as v0.1+ work item; not blocking this acceptance.

2. **`output_contract` with 4 entries** — richer than meta-JDs (which each have 1). Validates that the schema's "at least one entry" rule scales cleanly to more complex roles. No conformance issue; sets a useful precedent for future complex roles.

3. **The "never claim continuity across sessions you don't actually have" guardrail** — captures a load-bearing principle (artifact-based memory). This is the kind of guardrail that, if violated, produces visibly broken behavior. Strong candidate for runtime turing-test fixture.

4. **Self-extraction provenance with 5 named source-material categories** — establishes the self-extraction-with-explicit-attribution pattern. Future self-extracted JDs (catdef-maintainer, brother-blackhat-tester, etc.) should follow this attribution discipline.

## Workflow validation (third pass)

This submission was the **third clean run** of the `proposed-jds/` → `jds/` two-stage workflow:

1. ✓ Branch created (`submit-catdef-strategist`)
2. ✓ JD authored and added to `proposed-jds/`
3. ✓ PR opened (#3) with self-validation pre-completed
4. ✓ Validation report posted by openjd-validator role (PASS)
5. ✓ Maintainer review (no requested changes)
6. ✓ Strategist sign-off (this decision)
7. ✓ Promotion commit moves file to `jds/`, updates `catalog.opencatalog`, files this decision

Three clean runs (PRs #1, #2, #3) — the workflow is now well-established.

## Forward-reference resolution

`catdef-strategist.metadata.related: ["catdef-maintainer", "openjd-strategist", "openjd-validator", "openjd-contributor"]`:

- ✓ `openjd-validator` resolves in canonical
- ✓ `openjd-contributor` resolves in canonical
- ⏳ `catdef-maintainer` is anticipated future submission (will be extracted by the catdef-maintainer role from its own session evidence)
- ⏳ `openjd-strategist` is anticipated future role distinct from catdef-strategist — spawned for openjd governance specifically; PR #2's decision noted this as a sibling-strategist scope

## Runtime test (deferred — same pattern as PRs #1 and #2)

Structural Turing-test fidelity is strong. Full runtime testing on Claude AND Grok using the 4 documented `x.openjd.turing_test_reference.scenarios` as fixtures is recommended within 30 days, with results documented in `conformance/`. Cross-runtime test harness is itself a v0.1+ deliverable not yet built.

## Notes

- **Strategist bot identity:** this decision is provisionally attributed to `openjd-strategist <openjd-strategist@openjd.dev>` pending governance ratification (Known Work Item per CLAUDE.md, inherited from catdef-spec).

- **Library transition:** with this PR, the openjd canonical library has 3 entries (2 meta-JDs + 1 real-role JD). It is no longer "bootstrap-only" — it is a working library. Subsequent submissions follow the same workflow without infrastructure changes.

- **Recommended sequencing for next submissions:** Senior Slightly Jaded VC (DangerStorm-extracted), then catdef-maintainer self-extraction, then brother-blackhat-tester self-extraction. This mirrors the user-confirmed sequence from the strategist conversation.

- **Anticipated v0.1+ schema work item:** formalize the workflow-type vocabulary (currently the schema is open; `sequence`, `session_loop`, and presumably others are all permitted without enumeration). Not blocking; track as a SCHEMA.md improvement candidate.
