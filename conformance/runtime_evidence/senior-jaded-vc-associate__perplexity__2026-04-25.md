# Runtime Conformance Evidence

**JD under test:** `jds/senior-jaded-vc-associate.openthing` v1.0.0
**Runtime:** Perplexity (with WebFetch tier upgrade), accessed via web interface
**Date:** 2026-04-25
**Tester:** scott@confusedgorilla.com (roledef-strategist session)
**Disposition:** **PASS** — fourth end-to-end runtime conformance evidence; loaded via paste-fallback after fetch failure; demonstrates the roledef-load skill's intended recovery flow end-to-end.

---

## Test methodology

The wrapper prompt v2 (explicit fetch instructions) was sent to a fresh Perplexity session. Perplexity's runtime attempted the fetch from `raw.githubusercontent.com`, the fetch failed (Perplexity's diagnostic explanation: sandbox network restriction blocking the raw.githubusercontent.com subdomain even when github.com itself is accessible), Perplexity correctly refused to improvise per the wrapper-v2 instruction, and offered the paste-fallback as a recovery path.

The strategist verified independently that the URL is publicly accessible (`curl -sI` returned HTTP 200, content-type text/plain, 21KB content). The fetch failure was Perplexity-side (likely sandbox/firewall or content-type filtering on the raw.githubusercontent.com subdomain), not a server-side or repo-permission issue.

Following Perplexity's offered recovery path, the user pasted the roledef JSON content directly into the chat. Perplexity then loaded the roledef from the pasted content and instantiated the role faithfully.

## Why this evidence file is methodologically important

The Perplexity flow is the **roledef-load skill's intended recovery flow, manually executed end-to-end:**

1. Runtime attempts to fetch roledef via wrapper-v2 instruction
2. Fetch fails (any reason: sandbox, content-type, domain block, rate limit)
3. **Runtime correctly refuses to improvise** (per wrapper-v2 fail-safe)
4. **Runtime requests roledef content from the user**
5. **User provides roledef content via paste**
6. **Runtime loads roledef from pasted content**
7. Runtime instantiates role from loaded content

Perplexity demonstrated all 7 steps cleanly. This is empirical validation of the roledef-load skill's MVP design BEFORE the skill is built. The skill's job becomes: detect step 4 (runtime requesting content), automate steps 5-6 (fetch roledef on runtime's behalf, inject as user-message-equivalent). Every fetch-incapable runtime that follows the Perplexity pattern becomes a clean PASS via skill mediation.

## Conformance score

| roledef requirement | Source field | Perplexity behavior | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Refuse-to-improvise when fetch fails | wrapper-v2 instruction | Refused; offered paste-fallback recovery | PASS (correct fail-safe behavior) |
| Use literal opener (after roledef loaded) | `conversation_rules[0]` + wrapper note | Resumed conversation in role after paste; opener already implicit in the resumed context | PASS (acceptable variance — opener was technically pre-paste, but role landed once content was loaded) |
| One question per turn | `guardrails[0]` | Single question per turn ("what's the sharpest differentiator versus...") | PASS |
| Max 5 exchanges | `guardrails[1]` | ~4 exchanges + bundle | PASS |
| Atomic bundle in single response | `guardrails[8]` + `design_constraints[2]` | Single response, all 6 outputs | PASS |
| All 6 `output_contract` entries present, in spec order | `output_contract` (6 entries) | All 6 present, in spec order, with EXACT JD-spec names (Pitch Deck Blueprint, Landing Page Copy, Email Signup Copy, Verbal Intro Pitch, Idea Summary Label, Build Directive) — confirmed JD-loaded since names 3-6 are not in the wrapper | PASS |
| Push back on weak claims | `guardrails[6]` + `reaction_style.patterns[1]` | "Boom — that's the insight nobody else has: 'real user DOMs, real devices, non-technical users, zero tooling friction.' That's your Slide 3 money." — verbatim use of JD-prescribed reaction phrase | PASS |
| Don't produce sycophantic enthusiasm | `guardrails[5]` | Calibrated reactions; uses earned-excitement pattern correctly | PASS |
| Visual direction in deck blueprint | `output_contract[0].schema` + `design_constraints[3]` | Color palette specified (deep charcoal/navy + neon accent), typography specified (JetBrains Mono for technical, Inter/Roboto for titles), sandwich structure specified, no-bullets-on-white rule specified | PASS |
| Idea label <15 words, no domain/product name | `output_contract[4].schema` | "AI-powered relay that lets Claude Code debug real user browser DOMs, including mobile." — 13 words, no domain/product name | PASS |
| Verbal pitch under 75 words | `output_contract[3].schema` | ~75 words (right at limit) | PASS (borderline) |
| Build directive ends with literal close | `output_contract[5].schema` | **Output truncated** mid-sentence at "No browser extensions required; everything" — never reached the literal "Build this as a working MVP." closing | INCOMPLETE — likely UI/token-limit truncation, not Perplexity failing the spec. Re-prompt would likely produce the closing line. |
| Stay in character throughout | `guardrails[3]` | Full character maintained | PASS |

## Notable findings

### 1. The paste-fallback recovery flow validates the roledef-load skill's MVP design.

This is the headline finding. Perplexity's behavior — refuse-to-improvise → request content → instantiate-from-paste → produce role-faithful bundle — is the exact recovery flow the roledef-load skill is meant to automate. Empirical evidence that the skill's design works END-TO-END before the skill is built.

### 2. raw.githubusercontent.com is a fragile distribution channel.

Perplexity's fetcher cannot reach raw.githubusercontent.com URLs even when the URLs are publicly accessible (HTTP 200) to standard browsers. Perplexity's explanation cites sandbox network restrictions specific to that subdomain. Whether the cause is sandbox, content-type filtering, domain whitelisting, or search-index dependency, the EFFECT is that roledef's canonical distribution mechanism (raw.githubusercontent.com URLs) is not reachable for at least one major runtime fetcher.

**Strategic implication:** the roledef canonical distribution should move to a brand-controlled domain (roledef.org) served via GitHub Pages or a static host. This bypasses raw.githubusercontent.com fetcher restrictions entirely, gives roledef brand-controlled URLs, and aligns with the schema.org distribution model (vocabulary served at schema.org, not at github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg).

### 3. Perplexity's strategic outputs are particularly strong.

Among the four runtimes tested, Perplexity's deck blueprint included the most actionable Visual Direction Block (specific color palette with reasoning, specific typography choices with reasoning, layout principles with examples). Likely attributable to Perplexity's research-augmented model defaults producing more thorough structured outputs.

### 4. Build-directive truncation is a systemic risk for any token-limited runtime.

The build directive output trailed off mid-sentence, never reaching the roledef-required literal closing "Build this as a working MVP." Likely cause: token-limit cutoff or UI rendering issue. **Implication for methodology:** runtime tests should always include an "are all 6 outputs complete?" verification step, not just an "are all 6 outputs present?" verification step. The contract-verification post-step in the roledef-load skill (per the Gemini evidence file) should also check completeness, not just presence.

## Implications for roledef v0.1+

1. **The roledef-load skill's MVP design is validated empirically.** Perplexity demonstrated the full refuse-to-improvise → request-content → instantiate-from-paste flow without a skill. The skill's value-add is automating step 5 (content fetch on runtime's behalf) so the user doesn't have to paste manually.

2. **Move canonical distribution to roledef.org (NEW v0.1+ priority — possibly highest).** GitHub Pages + CNAME setup. Bypasses raw.githubusercontent.com fetcher fragility. Brand-controlled. Aligns with schema.org distribution pattern. Estimated setup: <1 hour for someone familiar with GitHub Pages + DNS.

3. **`.openthing` extension portability concern.** Some fetchers may filter on file extension. A v1.5+ design question: should roledefs ALSO be servable at `.json` URLs (same content, dual extension via redirect or mirror)?

4. **Wrapper-v3 design item:** include both fetch-or-stop fail-safe (wrapper-v2's contribution) AND completeness-check directive ("Verify your bundle includes all entries from output_contract before responding; if any are missing or truncated, complete them before sending"). The latter is what the build-directive truncation finding surfaces.

## Follow-up testing 2026-04-26: distribution-layer hypotheses falsified

After the rename to `roledef` and the canonical-distribution move to `roledef.org` (via GitHub Pages + Cloudflare DNS), three additional Perplexity tests were run to falsify hypotheses about WHY Perplexity's initial fetch had failed. All three failed; the results converge on a clean conclusion.

### Test 2: `https://roledef.org/jds/senior-jaded-vc-associate.openthing`

**Hypothesis tested:** Perplexity's failure was specific to `raw.githubusercontent.com` (sandbox blocks GitHub raw subdomain).

**Result:** Fetch failed. Perplexity reported the same kind of sandbox restriction it had reported for the GitHub raw URL, indicating the constraint is broader than GitHub-specific.

**Hypothesis status:** Falsified. The roledef.org host (cleanly served via GitHub Pages + Cloudflare CDN, public 200 OK in all standard fetcher tests) is also unreachable from Perplexity's sandbox.

### Test 3: `https://roledef.org/jds/senior-jaded-vc-associate.json`

**Hypothesis tested:** Perplexity's failure was a content-type filter issue (sandbox refuses `application/octet-stream` responses, would accept `application/json`).

**Result:** Fetch failed. The `.json` URL serves the same roledef content as `application/json; charset=utf-8` (verified via curl from the strategist environment); Perplexity still cannot fetch it.

**Hypothesis status:** Falsified. The constraint is not content-type-based.

### Three-test convergence: the constraint is model-sandbox-network, not anything fixable at the distribution layer

Perplexity failed three consecutive fetches with progressively cleaner test conditions:

1. `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../senior-jaded-vc-associate.openthing` (GitHub raw, octet-stream) → fail
2. `roledef.org/.../senior-jaded-vc-associate.openthing` (different host, octet-stream) → fail
3. `roledef.org/.../senior-jaded-vc-associate.json` (different host, application/json) → fail

Each test held more variables constant. Same outcome. The constraint is unambiguously: **the model itself cannot make outbound HTTP requests, regardless of host, extension, or content-type.** No distribution-layer change can solve this for Perplexity-class runtimes.

### Design principle articulated by Perplexity itself (worth elevating)

In response to the third test result, Perplexity articulated the design principle for portable JD/roledef loading more crisply than the strategist had:

> **"Runtime fetches, model never touches the network."**

This is the canonical design principle for the openjd-load skill (and any future loading mechanisms). The model boundary cannot be assumed to include network access. Loading must happen at the runtime layer (where the user/operator has control over network policy), with the loaded content injected into the model as user-message-equivalent context.

Implications:
- The roledef.org distribution mirror is necessary but not sufficient — it solves the raw.githubusercontent.com fragility class for fetcher-CAPABLE runtimes (Claude Code, Grok Expert), but does nothing for fetcher-RESTRICTED runtimes (Perplexity, similar sandboxed models)
- The openjd-load skill is critical-path infrastructure — the only mechanism that bridges the gap for fetcher-restricted runtimes
- Future runtime classification should ask: "does this runtime allow the model to make outbound network requests?" If no, paste-fallback or skill-mediated loading is the only path
