# Contributing to roledef

roledef is an open standard plus a community-curated reference library of AI roledefs. This document describes how to contribute — both new roledefs to the library and proposed changes to the spec.

## Governance

roledef is stewarded independently of any single AI vendor or implementation. The standard exists to enable interoperability between AI runtimes — Claude, Grok, GPT, Gemini, and any future runtime — not to codify any one vendor's prompt format.

**Vendors do not own the spec.** Anthropic, xAI, OpenAI, Google, Meta, and any future AI provider are equal citizens from roledef's perspective. Each is a runtime that can host roledef-instantiated roles. Each can propose changes. No one gets unilateral authorship.

**The library is curated; the spec is open.** The canonical library at `github.com/roledef-spec/roledef` (and its mirror at `roledef.org`) is curated for quality, fit, and breadth. The roledef schema itself is content-neutral and freely usable — anyone can publish their own roledef library at any URL using the same format. Forks are welcome.

### AI-assisted maintenance

roledef is maintained with AI-assisted review, following the pattern established by [catdef](https://github.com/catdef/catdef-spec). Routine work — drafting validation reports, reviewing roledef submissions, applying patch-level fixes — is drafted by Claude sessions operating under roles defined in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). These sessions operate under the dedicated identity `roledef-maintainer <roledef-maintainer@roledef.org>`. Merges to `main`, schema version bumps, and governance decisions are made only by human maintainers through the normal pull-request review process; the AI-maintainer identity does not have merge authority on protected branches.

## Three kinds of contribution

Contributions to roledef fall into three categories with different processes:

1. **Role submissions** (`roledef:Role`) — adding a new abstract Role to the canonical library
2. **Job artifacts** (`roledef:Job`) — Jobs (concrete org-specific instantiations) live in the **owning project's working repo**, not in the roledef canonical library. Some sample Jobs are mirrored to `sample-jobs/` for demonstration purposes.
3. **Spec proposals** — proposing changes to the roledef schema, the contribution process, or governance rules

## 1. Role submissions (`roledef:Role`)

### The two-stage workflow

roledefs follow a two-stage process via the `proposed-roledefs/` and `roledefs/` directories:

- `proposed-roledefs/` — submissions in flight; publicly visible but not yet promoted to canonical
- `roledefs/` — the canonical library; all entries here have passed validation and review

**Submission steps:**

1. **Fork** the repo
2. **Author your roledef** following the procedure in [README.md](README.md#authoring-a-jd) and the schema in [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md)
3. **Add the file** to `proposed-roledefs/<your-roledef-id>.openthing` in your fork
4. **Open a PR** against `main`
5. **Validation runs** (CI or manual roledef-validator) — produces a validation report posted on the PR
6. **Maintainer review** — checks scope, quality, library fit, attribution
7. **Strategist sign-off** — required for borderline cases (scope-edge, library-fit calls); routine clean validations are approved on maintainer alone
8. **Promotion at merge** — the maintainer updates the PR to atomically:
   - Move the file from `proposed-roledefs/` to `roledefs/`
   - Add the entry to `catalog.opencatalog`
   - Add a decision artifact to `decisions/<id>.md` with the rationale
9. **Merge**

Once merged, the roledef is part of the canonical library and is available via `github.com/roledef-spec/roledef/blob/main/roledefs/<id>.openthing` and (eventually) `roledef.org/roledefs/<id>`.

### Validation expectations

A submission MUST pass:

- **Schema validation** — all MUST fields present per [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md), correct catdef wrapping, valid versioning, no reserved namespace misuse
- **Turing test on at least one runtime** — a fresh AI runtime loaded with the roledef produces behavior equivalent to the original-incumbent's documented behavior

A submission SHOULD pass:

- **Turing test on multiple runtimes** (cross-runtime portability)
- **Self-description for all extensions** (per the SHOULD-rule in SCHEMA.md)
- **Rich `reaction_style.examples`** for downstream Turing-test validation by future implementers

### Quality bar

The library is curated. Even valid roledefs may be rejected for:

- **Redundancy** — the library already has good coverage of this role; the maintainer will discuss whether the new submission improves on existing entries or whether you should fork the existing roledef instead
- **Scope** — the role is too narrow (only useful for one specific company), too broad ("a generic helpful AI"), or outside roledef's intended scope
- **Quality** — the roledef authoritatively describes the role but the role itself isn't well-designed (vague guardrails, contradictory rules, no clear output_contract)

If your roledef is rejected for the canonical library, you can still publish it at any URL using the same format. Your roledef is just as portable from your own URL as from roledef's. Curation is not censorship.

### What goes in `proposed-roledefs/`

- Files MUST be valid `.openthing` files conforming to [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md)
- Filenames MUST match the roledef's `id` field exactly: `<id>.openthing`
- IDs MUST be unique across `proposed-roledefs/` AND `roledefs/` (no shadowing)
- Each submission SHOULD include (in the PR description):
  - The role's source — extracted from a product? Self-authored from session experience? Designed from scratch? Derived from another roledef?
  - Reference behavior — link to transcripts, prompts, or examples that establish the original behavior the roledef is trying to capture
  - Turing test plan — which runtime(s) to test on, what scenarios

### Derived roledefs (specializations of existing roles)

When you want a specialization of an existing roledef — for example, an `sncro-blackhat-tester` derived from a generic `blackhat-tester` — use **git forking**, not a runtime-merged inheritance mechanism. roledef intentionally has no runtime `extends` semantics for v0.1; the simpler git-fork pattern handles derivation cleanly.

**Procedure for authoring a derived roledef:**

1. **Copy the parent file.** Either via `git checkout`-then-copy or by clicking "Raw" on GitHub and saving locally. The derived file starts as a complete copy of the parent — same structure, same fields, same content.

2. **Change the `id`** to the derived id (e.g., `sncro-blackhat-tester`). This must be unique across the library.

3. **Modify what's specialized.** Add domain-specific surface knowledge to `identity` and `description`. Add domain-specific examples to `reaction_style.examples`. Tighten output_contract entries if the derived role has stricter formats. Add domain-specific guardrails (additive only — see "Conventions for safe derivation" below).

4. **Declare the lineage** in `metadata.derived_from`:

   ```json
   "metadata": {
     "derived_from": {
       "id": "blackhat-tester",
       "version": "1.0.0",
       "url": "https://roledef.org/roledefs/blackhat-tester.openthing"
     },
     ...
   }
   ```

   This is a SHOULD pattern. The runtime does NOT resolve `derived_from` as inheritance — it's purely declarative for lineage transparency, validation chain navigation, and library curation.

5. **Submit as a normal roledef** via the standard two-stage workflow. The derived roledef is a first-class artifact in its own right.

**Conventions for safe derivation** (per SCHEMA.md `metadata.derived_from` SHOULD-rules):

- **Guardrails: additive only.** Don't remove or relax parent guardrails.
- **Voice and identity: refinable, not contradictable.** A derivation can specialize the parent's register but shouldn't reverse it.
- **Output contract: additive + tightenable.** Add new entries; tighten existing entry constraints; don't remove or loosen.
- **Workflow: replaceable with notice.** May replace if the derived domain genuinely needs a different sequence; declare prominently when this happens.
- **Reaction style examples: additive.** Preserve parent examples; add specialization examples.

These conventions make `derived_from` declarations meaningful — readers can trust that derived roledefs honor the parent's safety/validation properties unless prominently noted otherwise.

**When NOT to use the derived pattern:**

- If your specialization is so different from the parent that it shares only the role-name, just author it as a standalone roledef. Forced inheritance hides more than it reveals.
- If the specialization is for one specific user/project and won't be reused, it might fit better as runtime-context (loaded via the wrapper prompt's optional Section 6 scaffolding) rather than as a published roledef.

**Example:** the `blackhat-tester` (abstract methodology) → `sncro-blackhat-tester` (sncro-specialized) pair is the canonical first example of this pattern. See those two files in `roledefs/` (when published) for a concrete reference.

## 2. Job artifacts (`roledef:Job`)

A Job is a concrete instantiation of a Role at a specific organization, carrying org-specific specializations (charter, placement, additional guardrails, etc.). Per the role-vs-job distinction (see [SCHEMA.md §"Roles vs Jobs"](SCHEMA.md#roles-vs-jobs)), Jobs and Roles are distinct artifact tiers with different ownership and location patterns.

### Jobs live in working repos, not in the canonical library

A Job artifact lives in the **working repo of the org that defines it**, at one of:

- `<project>/<org-name>-org/jobs/<job-id>.openthing` (when the project hosts a nested org folder, common for multi-org projects)
- `<project>/jobs/<job-id>.openthing` (when the project is a single-org project; the project itself IS the org)

This mirrors the catdef-org memo convention's per-recipient working-repo discipline: **authorization to read and modify a Job artifact is implied by repo access**. Public projects (catdef-family, DangerStorm-style open-extraction projects) publish their operational Jobs in public repos; private orgs keep their Jobs in private repos. There is no separate "private flag" — repo visibility IS the visibility.

`orgdef:Position` references to private Jobs gracefully fail to resolve for outsiders (404); the org's own sessions resolve them via authenticated git access. This mirrors how private package-manager dependencies work.

### How to author a Job

1. **Identify the parent Role** in the canonical library (or another library / a third-party Role). Pin it in `metadata.role_definition` with `id`, `version`, and `url`.
2. **Identify the org context** — the orgdef this Job exists in. Pin it in `metadata.org_definition`.
3. **Write the charter** — a single statement of the stable slot of responsibility this Job fills (`charter` top-level field).
4. **Add specializations** as additive material per the conventions for safe derivation (additional guardrails, refined voice, additional reaction_style examples, tightened output_contract entries). Honor the additive-only invariant against the parent Role.
5. **Add `metadata.placement`** (optional but RECOMMENDED) — a denormalized snapshot of the Job's org-chart placement (`reports_to`, `directs`, `coordinates_with`).
6. **Run OPD** (when `workflow.type: "engagement_loop"` and `metadata.role_definition` is set) — see [SCHEMA.md §"Ongoing Professional Development (OPD)"](SCHEMA.md#ongoing-professional-development-opd).

### Sample Jobs in `sample-jobs/`

The canonical roledef library at `github.com/roledef-spec/roledef` hosts a `sample-jobs/` directory for **canonical sample Jobs** — demonstration artifacts that document patterns and serve as adopter starting-points. Sample Jobs are NOT operational (no live org-holder occupies them).

Sample Jobs follow the same submission flow as Roles (PR to canonical, validator runs, strategist signs off on library fit), but are placed in `sample-jobs/<id>.openthing` rather than `roledefs/<id>.openthing`. The bootstrap-era artifacts that are conceptually Job-shaped (catdef-strategist, roledef-strategist, sncro-blackhat-tester, senior-jaded-vc-associate) are mirrored as sample-of-record entries here while operational copies live at their owning project repos.

### Jobs typically do not flow through the canonical library

Most Jobs in real use stay in their owning project's working repo. There is no central registry of Jobs. The canonical library curates **Roles** (broadly applicable) and **sample Jobs** (canonical demonstrations); operational Jobs live where the org-holder lives.

When a Job has broad pedagogical or pattern-establishing value, it MAY be submitted to `sample-jobs/` via the same PR workflow as Roles. This is a curation call (strategist sign-off required); not every well-formed Job warrants canonical sample-of-record placement.

## 3. Spec proposals

Changes to the roledef schema, the contribution process, or governance rules use a separate workflow via the `proposals/` directory.

### When to propose

- The schema is missing a field your domain genuinely needs (and it doesn't fit as an `x.<domain>.<identifier>` extension)
- An existing rule has unintended consequences you've experienced empirically
- The contribution workflow has friction that's preventing legitimate contributions
- A new conformance test would catch a class of validation failures the current tests miss

### When NOT to propose

- **Domain-specific features.** If your use case is expressible as `x.<domain>.<identifier>`, use that. The schema stays minimal on purpose.
- **Wishlist items without a concrete use case.** "Wouldn't it be cool if..." without empirical motivation gets deferred.
- **Vendor-specific accommodations.** roledef is runtime-agnostic. If a feature only makes sense for one vendor's runtime, it belongs in their own tooling, not the spec.

### Proposal artifact format

Use the format described in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#proposal-artifact-format). Each proposal is a markdown file in `proposals/`, named `<short-name>.md`. The format includes Summary, Motivation, Proposed Change, Backward Compatibility, Conformance Tests, Alternatives Considered, and Open Questions.

### Proposal workflow

1. **Open** — file the proposal as a PR adding `proposals/<name>.md`
2. **Discuss** — open period for community/maintainer/strategist input
3. **Iterate** — the proposal is refined based on feedback
4. **Decide** — the roledef-strategist files a decision in `decisions/proposal-<name>.md`: Accept | Accept with Modifications | Reject | Defer
5. **Implement** (if accepted) — the roledef-maintainer drafts the actual schema change as a follow-on PR
6. **Version bump** — accepted spec changes bump the roledef schema version per the rules in [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md#versioning)

## Test suite (conformance)

The conformance suite in [`conformance/`](conformance/) is the practical expression of the standard. A change to the spec without test coverage is incomplete. Contributions to the test suite are as valuable as contributions to the spec text.

The conformance suite contains:

- **`valid_roledefs/`** — roledefs that should pass validation; used as positive controls
- **`invalid_roledefs/`** — roledefs with specific known violations; used to validate the validator
- **`tests/`** — the validation test code

A submitted roledef's PR MAY include additions to `conformance/` if the submission exercises new schema territory.

**The test suite is the standard.** A roledef that passes the suite is roledef-conformant. A roledef that doesn't, isn't.

## License

roledef is MIT licensed. The schema is MIT. The reference library roledefs are MIT (each carries its own `metadata.license` field; deviations from MIT must be flagged at submission time and may affect library inclusion).

If you fork roledef or publish your own roledef library, you choose your own license.

## Bot identity (for AI sessions)

When AI sessions commit to roledef as part of the AI-assisted maintenance workflow, they use these identities:

- **`roledef-maintainer <roledef-maintainer@roledef.org>`** — for maintainer drafts (proposals, validation reports, schema PRs)
- **`roledef-strategist <roledef-strategist@roledef.org>`** — for strategist decision artifacts (provisional, pending governance ratification per the [Strategist Bot Identity](CLAUDE.md#known-work-items) Known Work Item inherited from catdef)
- **`roledef-validator <roledef-validator@roledef.org>`** — for automated validation reports (when CI-driven)

The committer is always the human steward. AI sessions never have merge authority.
